We can use relatively simple image processing and computer vision techniques in Python, without OpenCV library. With careful experimental design, a digital camera or a flatbed scanner, in conjunction with some Python code, can be a powerful instrument in answering many different kinds of problems. Consider the following two types of problems that might be of interest to a scientist.
